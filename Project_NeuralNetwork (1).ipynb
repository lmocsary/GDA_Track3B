        "Our data set, called the  \"Home Equity\" or , in brief, HMEQ data set, is provided by www.creditriskanalytics.net. It comprises  information about a set of borrowers, which are categorized along demographic variables and variables concerning their business relationship with the lender. A binary target variable called 'BAD' is  provided and indicates whether a borrower has repaid her/his debt. You can think of the data as a standard use case of binary classification.\n",

        "You obtain the data, together with other interesting finance data sets, directly from www.creditriskanalytics.net. The website also provides a brief description of the data set. Specifically, the data set consists of 5,960 observations and 13 features including the target variable. The variables are defined as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "- BAD: the target variable, 1=default; 0=non-default \n",
        "- LOAN: amount of the loan request\n",
        "- MORTDUE: amount due on an existing mortgage\n",
        "- VALUE: value of current property\n",
        "- REASON: DebtCon=debt consolidation; HomeImp=home improvement\n",
        "- JOB: occupational categories\n",
        "- YOJ: years at present job\n",
        "- DEROG: number of major derogatory reports\n",
        "- DELINQ: number of delinquent credit lines\n",
        "- CLAGE: age of oldest credit line in months\n",
        "- NINQ: number of recent credit inquiries\n",
        "- CLNO: number of credit lines\n",
        "- DEBTINC: debt-to-income ratio\n",
